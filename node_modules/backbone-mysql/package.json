  "readme": "# backbone-mysql\n\nA sync module for Backbone.js and Node.js for use with MySQL. The motivation behind this module is that most of the ORM's for Node.js are kind of crappy. They either have bugs which make them unusable or they impliment a promises interace that is not to my liking. I was also looking for something that would work mostly the same on the frontend as the backend so that our developers can learn just one framework.\n\n## Getting Started\nInstall the module with: `npm install backbone-mysql`\n\n```javascript\nvar Backbone = require('backbone-mysql');\nvar mysql = require('mysql');\nBackbone.client = mysql.createClient();\n\nvar MyModel = Backbone.Model.extend({\n  urlRoot: '/users'\n});\n\nvar example = new MyModel({ id: 1 });\nexample.fetch({\n  success: function (model, response, options) {\n    model.save({ name: 'Foo' }, {\n      success: function (model, response, options) {\n        // Do somthing awesome here.\n      }\n    });\n  }\n});\n```\n\nSince the promises/callback pattern for Backbone is not very Node.js-ish I would recommend using [https://npmjs.org/package/backbone-callbacks](backbone-callbacks) to make things feel more native.\n\n## Documentation\n_(Coming soon)_\n\n## Examples\n_(Coming soon)_\n\n## Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt).\n\n## Release History\nv0.1.0 Inital Development Release\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2012 Chris Cowan  \nLicensed under the MIT license.\n",
